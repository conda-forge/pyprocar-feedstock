  summary: A Python library for electronic structure pre/post-processing.

  description: |
    PyProcar is a robust, open-source Python library used for pre- and
    post-processing of the electronic structure data coming from DFT
    calculations. PyProcar provides a set of functions that manage data
    obtained from the PROCAR format. Basically, the PROCAR format is a
    projection of the Kohn-Sham states over atomic orbitals. That
    projection is performed to every k-point in the considered mesh,
    every energy band and every atom. PyProcar is capable of performing
    a multitude of tasks including plotting plain and spin/atom/orbital
    projected band structures and Fermi surfaces- both in 2D and 3D, Fermi
    velocity plots, unfolding bands of a super cell, comparing band
    structures from multiple DFT calculations, plotting partial density
    of states and generating a k-path for a given crystal structure.
